## Dice Rolling Simulator
### Structure
- The min and max roll values are set by two constants
- Inside a while loop:
    - the program ask the user if they want to roll the dice
    - the answer is then checked:
        - if the answer is 'no', the program exits
        - if the answer is 'yes', a random number is generated and printed
        - if the answer is in an invalid format, the program says so and asks the user again whether they want to roll the dice
